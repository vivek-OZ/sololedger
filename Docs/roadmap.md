# üõ£Ô∏è SoloLedger Project Roadmap

**SoloLedger** is an open-source iOS app designed to help sole traders ‚Äî especially fitness instructors and service professionals ‚Äî track income, expenses, receipts, and payment status in a clean, cloud-native mobile interface.

The project is built using SwiftUI and Firebase and is inspired by real-world needs, starting with a fitness instructor's experience managing her sole trader business.
